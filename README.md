Our idea is to create an app which can help in preventing the spread of future epidemics and pandemics using the help of new technology.Our idea is to use the app to provide people with data of general movement of the population in a speciic area and time slot so that they may make informed decisions on where to go and when to go or to just stay at home.Contact tracing can be made leaps and bounds easier using this app.

### Update 1 - 8 Hours Mark
* *Have you made any new Ideas?*

So far,we've have come up with a few different implementations of our ideas along with some ways to build upon on our basic idea.We have made a few changes to make it expandable,easy to use and increase its functionality even in the long run.

* *As a team, write a brief paragraph about what problem your team is trying to solve?*

As a team we are trying to solve the issue of contact tracing and raising awareness among the general public in order to prevent the spread of future outbreaks. Right now contact tracing is a largely govermental process and limited data is available to the public. However our goal is to solve the issue of the current inability of people to make informed decisions with respect to going to specific places like a nearby grocery for example by providing them with relavent data which will help them make a informed decision. 

* *What sub-topic has your team chosen? Or did you choose a topic not within the specified topics?*

We've chosen the topic of public health with regard/respect to epidemiology.

* *Could you list the ideas you plan to implement in your project?**

List of ideas we are trying to implement:
1.Make relevant data available to the public.
2.Possibly reduce time and money spent on contact tracing .
3.Make the public more aware in terms of spread of infection
4.Make an app which can be easily updated to adapt to suit future pandemics as well.
5.Make it user friendly/easy to interact with.

* *What language (programming) are you using?*

We have chosen C++ as our language of choice due to its simplicity and our existing knowledge of it.

* *Comments?*

So far this has been a very fun first experience of a hackathon to all of us and we're now familiar with how hackathons work and look forward to taking part in more of them in the coming future.
