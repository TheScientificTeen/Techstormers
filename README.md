Our idea is to create an app which can help in preventing the spread of future epidemics and pandemics using the help of new technology.Our idea is to use the app to provide people with data of general movement of the population in a speciic area and time slot so that they may make informed decisions on where to go and when to go or to just stay at home.Contact tracing can be made leaps and bounds easier using this app.

## Updates

### Final Update - 24 Hours Mark

500 Words about your completed project

This completed project encompasses the baby-steps of the creation of our project. This project requires to be modified with greater coding expertise, and professionalism.
The core idea of the project includes the abstraction and encapsulation of data, and presenting the most necessary o the data to the user. This is made in a way to keep most data safe and non-violation of privacy. We started off with the idea that every person takes a quick quiz that can be completed in a few seconds, a minute at the most, whose data is fed to the servers based on their risks of contaminativity. This data is encapsulated in the server, and when a user requests for data, the server provides the data which are crucial for the person's safety precautions. This project could be taken further, by using GPS tracking to track high,medium and low risk individuals appearing on the user interface, enabling the user to saty cautios and away from the contracting communicable fatal diseases. Also, the current data was provided in the form of number of different persons in various risks in numbers. The main idea was it however created a gradient(heat-map of sorts) to provide the details such as the number of persons who have been to a specific place with varying gradients to indicate the risks of spread. This idea, which can be a breakthrough, requires a higher hardware-powered server, and mcuh more of coding expertise, which we look forward to develop in the future, and make this project a success. The app can also be expanded to various other communicable diseases and their rates and risks of contaminivity. This idea can be represneted with multiple/few quizzes to diagnose the user of any possibility of being a risky individual. This was a gist of the project, which is anticipated to expanded to other fields and diseases as well. 

### Update 2 - 16 Hours Mark
* *Have you made any new Ideas?**

Yes, we have continued to build up on our core ideas and have made improvements that will make the overall quality better.

* *Could you list some more ideas you plan to implement in your project?*

We have implemented a few more ideas into our project such as:
1. We've added a home page. 
2. Live covid 19 data in the home page. 
3. We've added an interactive map whihc allows the user to select the area and the time slot. 
4. We've added a new feature which advises the users on the nessesary precautions which need to be taken to visit a place or after returning from a place.

* *Comments?*

It's been a really good and unique experience so far and we've learnt a lot in the topics on which we're basing our project apon. 

### Update 1 - 8 Hours Mark
* *Have you made any new Ideas?*

So far,we've have come up with a few different implementations of our ideas along with some ways to build upon on our basic idea.We have made a few changes to make it expandable,easy to use and increase its functionality in the long run.

* *As a team, write a brief paragraph about what problem your team is trying to solve?*

As a team we are trying to solve the issue of contact tracing and raising awareness among the general public in order to prevent the spread of future outbreaks. Right now contact tracing is a largely govermental process and limited data is available to the public. However our goal is to solve the issue of the current inability of people to make informed decisions with respect to going to specific places like a nearby grocery for example by providing them with relavent data which will help them make a informed decision. 

* *What sub-topic has your team chosen? Or did you choose a topic not within the specified topics?*

We've chosen the topic of public health with regard/respect to epidemiology.

* *Could you list the ideas you plan to implement in your project?**

List of ideas we are trying to implement:
1. Make relevant data available to the public.
2. Possibly reduce time and money spent on contact tracing .
3. Make the public more aware in terms of spread of infection
4. Make an app which can be easily updated to adapt to suit future pandemics as well.
5. Make it user friendly/easy to interact with.

* *What language (programming) are you using?*

We have chosen C++ as our language of choice due to its simplicity and our existing knowledge of it.

* *Comments?*

So far this has been a very fun first experience of a hackathon to all of us and we're now familiar with how hackathons work and look forward to taking part in more of them in the coming future.
